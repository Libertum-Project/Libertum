      answer: (
        <ul>
          <li>
            $LBM is an ERC-20 token on the Polygon Smart Chain with a maximum
            supply of only 200,000,000 (200 million).{" "}
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            The $LBM Token is the native token on the blockchain that is the
            backbone of the Libertum fractionalized rental income ecosystem.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            The token contract address
            isâ€¯0x7C5f61351339B7a516ba1e7fC0d9052042CC4875. Please do not send
            any funds to this token contract address, as they cannot be
            recovered. $LBM can currently only be purchased through the official
            presale at buy.libertum.io

      answer: (
        <ul>
          <li>
            The $LBM token will be fueling the vibrant Libertum rental income
            ecosystem. The $LBM token will provide long term rewards for holders
            of the $LBM token in the form of revenue share through the staking
            pool.â€¯It will generate a 10% return to the $LBM token holders
            annually. Moreover, it may form a payment overlay network alongside
            fiat transactions that will ease the barrier to entry into the
            Libertum ecosystem for those among the unbanked (i.e. no access to
            traditional financial services).{" "}
