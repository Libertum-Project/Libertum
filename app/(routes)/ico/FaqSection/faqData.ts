    question: "Why the $LBM token?",
    answer: `<p>The $LBM token will be fueling the vibrant Libertum rental income ecosystem. The $LBM token will provide long term rewards for holders of the $LBM token in the form of revenue share through the staking pool.â€¯It will generate a 10% return to the $LBM token holders annually. Moreover, it may form a payment overlay network alongside fiat transactions that will ease the barrier to entry into the Libertum ecosystem for those among the unbanked (i.e. no access to traditional financial services).</p>`,
